# Microsoft Access Databases
Collection of code relating to MS Access databases I have worked on.

**check-brackets-end**

Checks the last character in a users entry into a text box when the box is exited. If character is not a closing bracket then it appears they have forgotten to initial in brackets their entry and so a message box reminder pops up

**see-end-of-text.vba**
For a text box which is long due to a large number of entries this code brings the end of the last entry into view instead of having to manually use the scroll bar when focus is brought to the text box.
