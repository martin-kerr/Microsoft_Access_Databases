# Microsoft_Access_Databases
Collection of code relating to MS Access databases I have worked on.

**Check_Brackets_end**

Checks the last character in a users entry into a text box when the box is exited. If character is not a closing bracket then it appears they have forgotten to initial in brackets their entry and so a message box reminder pops up
